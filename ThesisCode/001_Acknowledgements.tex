I am grateful to the many people who have inspired, challenged and supported me throughout my PhD trajectory. I extend my gratitude and indebtedness first and foremost to the rural households that shared a small part of their stories with us. I also wish to express my gratitude to the enumerators who guided these detailed and at times sensitive discussions.

To my promotor, Imke de Boer, thank you for asking such challenging questions, for the frank and open discussions and for hosting me. To your credit, you have cultivated a high performing and supportive work culture, for which I am glad to have been a part. To my co-promotor Simon Oosting, thank you for your support, for sharing your insights and for your dedicated input right up to submission. To my co-promotor Mark van Wijk, your leadership and collaborative spirit has provided exciting opportunities to better understand the circumstances of rural households across Africa, Asia and south-central America. I am grateful for your insights, feedback and encouragement. You have shaped and enriched this thesis and have given me the freedom to make this research my own. Thank you. 

To my unofficial supervisor, Mats Lannerstad, you were instrumental in the formation of this PhD project and have been an active contributor throughout my PhD trajectory. Your leadership in the CLEANED project provided me with immense opportunities to develop my research capacities. I would also like to thank you for the brainstorming sessions, critical feedback and well-timed bouts of laughter.  

To my other highly esteemed co-authors, it has been a pleasure to work with you all. I would like to take the opportunity to single out a few individuals in this public acknowledgement.
